# Multi-Class Classification

This repository contains an implementation of a **Multi-Class Classification** model using machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and optimize a classifier for handling multiple categories in a dataset.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing and feature engineering for multi-class classification.
- Model training using machine learning algorithms.
- Performance evaluation with relevant metrics.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements
Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ”¥ Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Magnus0969/Multi-Class-Classification.git
   cd Multi-Class-Classification
   ```
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate.py
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
